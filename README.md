### Disease

#### * General
A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting many joints, including those in the hands and feet.  
In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints. In severe cases, it attacks internal organs.

#### * Sympotoms
Rheumatoid arthritis affects joint linings, causing painful swelling. Over long periods of time, the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can cause bone erosion and joint deformity.  
Pain areas: in the joints, back, or muscles  
Joints: stiffness, swelling, tenderness, or weakness  
Whole body: fatigue, anemia, or malaise  
Skin: lumps or redness  
Hand: bump on the finger or swelling  
Also common: flare, dry mouth, physical deformity, or sensation of pins and needles  

#### * Treatments
While there's no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, physiotherapy and medication can help slow the disease's progression. Most cases can be managed with a class of medications called anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS)
